1
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,077
Before we start the competition,

2
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:27,669
let's mourn for Kaizawa Shimataka,

3
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,737
former Japanese Lightweight Boxing Champion,

4
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:34,033
who died a few days ago.

5
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,500
My boxing colleagues, 
let's stand in silent to tribute him.

6
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:14,254
THE BOXERerer

7
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,246
Now let's move on to the event.

8
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:24,623
I hereby announce the All Japan Lightweight
Boxing Competition Final commences.

9
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,271
Director:  Shuji Terayama

10
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,906
The dog is strolling again. Go.

11
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,593
I told him dogs were not allowed here.

12
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,712
Mr Hayato, Mr Hayato.

13
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,027
I told you that you mustn't have dogs here.

14
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,715
He is undoubtedly inside,

15
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,330
but always pretend not being there 
when I want to talk to him.

16
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,361
I have never seen him uttering a 
single word since he moved here.

17
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:35,501
Hey, I'm ready to shoot.

18
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,320
Look here.

19
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,424
Say "cheese".

20
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,591
Good.

21
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:51,422
Brother, come and take a photo.

22
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,654
Get up.

23
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:53,899
Take a photo with us, will you?

24
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,531
We will send it to Mina.

25
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,596
Isn't that nice?

26
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,421
Please join us.

27
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,423
Get up, brother.

28
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,762
You two go ahead.

29
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,289
Your brother is unhappy, isn't he?

30
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:31,434
Never mind, he's just like that.

31
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:37,182
"You two go ahead." huh.

32
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,368
Damn, you guys dare to post here!

33
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:12,890
Were you OK last night?

34
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:18,787
No problem. In the end, 
just one punch and my opponent was down.

35
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,613
Dude, you are good at it, aren't you?

36
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:25,641
It's really tough. The situation wasn't
to my advantage until Round 9.

37
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,939
You have indeed decided to marry him?

38
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,525
I'm sorry.

39
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,767
So you were never serious with me?

40
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,564
Tenma, help me operate the crane for a while.

41
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,069
Flirting with girls early in the morning?

42
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,154
Go back to work. Work!

43
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:56,923
Dumped again?

44
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,002
Damn.

45
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:31,966
Go back to work. Work!

46
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,120
It's an accident,

47
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,910
probably due to carelessness.

48
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,030
No, that's not an accident.

49
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,150
It's intended.

50
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,150
(A running commentary 
on a horse racing on TV)

51
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:18,190
Kitahaya is the first.
He's reached the end. He's made it.

52
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,080
He made it last time too, didn't he?

53
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,000
Banzai!

54
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,390
It's really a pity.

55
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,930
Thank you. Thank you.

56
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,660
Wait a moment.

57
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,463
You haven't paid for your meal.

58
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,340
Wait.

59
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,012
Let him go. He'll be back and pay for it.

60
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,380
Come back and pay for it, no way.

61
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,830
He always eats on credit.

62
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,630
How can it be so easy!

63
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,120
OK, I'm wrong.

64
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,530
These guys are used to having free meals.

65
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,460
We couldn't afford to 
have this kind of customers.

66
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,205
Mouth wide open.
What are you doing here?

67
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:54,772
Beat it.

68
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,620
Why don't you eat?

69
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,561
Stomach problem?

70
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,926
I'm supposed to maintain weight.

71
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,590
The chickens are running away.

72
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,910
Catch them, help me catch them.

73
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,120
Excuse me.

74
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,400
Could you help to catch it?

75
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,370
Then how could I read?

76
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,650
What should we do, boss?

77
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
The chickens are running out.

78
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,740
Who are you?

79
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,490
Is there a Tenma here?

80
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,510
Tenma?

81
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,710
You mean little Ten?

82
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,110
I want to see him.

83
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,370
He is probably in the 
training place right now.

84
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,990
Training place?

85
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,480
I can take you there.

86
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,610
Pay attention to your movement.

87
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,300
Only 30 seconds more!

88
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:40,232
Keep going.

89
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,530
Good.

90
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,189
Goto!
- Yes.

91
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,730
Pay attention to your feet.

92
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,841
Your feet.

93
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,561
That guy with bad foot is Tenma, isn't he?

94
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,960
It's you son-of-bitch 
who killed my brother, huh.

95
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,085
Your girl dumped you, so you...

96
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,801
Let him go.

97
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,870
The police have decided it's an accident.

98
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,760
You shut up.

99
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,550
Don't be so rude.

100
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,350
It's no longer the time 
you could swagger about.

101
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,550
Go away.

102
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,440
Go away.

103
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,370
Beat it.

104
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,681
Go away.

105
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,360
I'll let you go this time 
as my first match is drawing near. 

106
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,490
You mean, that guy is...

107
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,680
Yes, former featherweight 
boxing champion of Japan.

108
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,330
Blood is all over it during his last 
match. I still remember it vividly.

109
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,820
Never been defeated,

110
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:28,160
and sure to win that time,
he suddenly quit in the middle.

111
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,742
Quit in the middle of a match 
he was sure to win...

112
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,340
Truly a strange man.

113
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,411
It's a mystery that 
I couldn't understand either.

114
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,290
Hello.

115
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,908
Is he in?

116
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:54,770
No idea.

117
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,770
Well, my father said he hadn't 
paid the rent for a long time.

118
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,210
Please tell him

119
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,506
the dog is really annoying, 
smells rather bad.

120
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,174
Not home?

121
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,330
He's in.

122
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,330
Look, right?

123
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,090
Who are you?

124
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,260
How stubborn!

125
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,270
Get up please!

126
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,430
I'll leave if you don't get up.

127
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,850
I bring your favorite, assorted 
spiced vegetables specially for you.

128
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,540
What, you again.

129
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,780
"What, you again."

130
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,740
Why not me?

131
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,319
I told you not to come here.

132
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,680
Even if you told me not, 
I will still keep coming.

133
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,820
until you fully recover.

134
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,824
Are you mad about my remarriage?

135
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,110
It's you who had abandoned me.

136
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,830
Gossip is a fearful thing.

137
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,184
You were not like this before.

138
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,350
You didn't care what others say.

139
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,778
Mizue said she wanted to come here. 
Has she come?

140
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,040
Only once.

141
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,250
No! We mustn't destroy 
the father image in her.

142
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,740
The kid still believes her father 
is a champion, a great man.

143
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,670
Hey, hold me.

144
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,920
What are you talking about!

145
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,058
Just as before.

146
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,635
Hey, hold me!

147
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:46,077
Go home.

148
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:49,537
You're angry! You're angry!

149
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,670
You haven't been angry for a long time.

150
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:53,003
Go away.

151
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,467
You're angry, then hit me, hit me please.

152
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,070
Leave here, don't come back.

153
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,963
I won't leave.

154
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,540
How could you be like this?

155
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,090
Have you ever considered my feelings?

156
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,061
Hey, hurry up.

157
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,932
The match could begin anytime.

158
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,657
OK, I'm done.

159
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:33,497
Let's go. Hoho.

160
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,801
I don't want to go.

161
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,830
Tenma.

162
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,551
Are you hungry?

163
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:36,778
I hereby anounce the 
commence of the match.

164
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:45,272
The players:

165
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,630
Tenma Tessho.

166
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,002
Fight, fight!

167
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,480
Good! Corner him! Hit!

168
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,354
Take advantage of his bad feet.

169
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:11,019
Move faster. And keep going.

170
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,413
He couldn't catch up with you
with his feet.

171
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,834
Hit him, you fool.

172
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,817
One blow and he's down.

173
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:32,433
Isn't that good?

174
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,036
Let's enjoy some drink.

175
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,297
I will be better next time.

176
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,040
Next time? There is no next time.

177
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,160
It's pretty much hopeless 
to box with your feet.

178
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,412
In case you're hurt, it can be a serious 
problem. I'm afraid you have to quit.

179
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,587
Then I refused it at once.

180
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,317
I said "I won't act in a 
kiss scene I don't accept."

181
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,340
which upset the whole crew.

182
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,230
Even the director was worried.

183
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,820
Takahashi Tenji, the actor who played 
opposite me, was the poorest guy.

184
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,390
His feelings were severely hurt.

185
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,290
Last time, you said it was Keiji Sada 
who played opposite you.

186
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,030
Oh, that's another film.

187
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,619
I made totally 170 films after all.

188
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,399
What happened after that?

189
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,780
Of course I didn't compromise.

190
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,504
That's for sure.

191
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,413
I retained my pride.

192
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,060
It's a beautiful story, very beautiful.

193
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,348
What was your stage name at that time?

194
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,800
Well, you wouldn't know even if I tell you.

195
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,084
Hey, don't take this away, 
I need it to keep cool.

196
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:51,577
I'm sorry.

197
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,420
But, if I had agreed 
to act in that scene,

198
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,926
I would become the first Japanese 
female star appearing in a kiss scene.

199
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,370
How I want to know

200
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,218
What's your stage name then?

201
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,105
Don't intrude others' past.

202
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,469
Everyone has something in their past 
they don't wish others know.

203
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,530
You must have a lot fans then.

204
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,400
Of course.

205
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,620
How much could you earn a day?

206
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,347
Boxing is not for the handicapped.

207
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,732
I suggest you choosing 
another career path.

208
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,731
Okabe Daizo, Eagle Boxing Society

209
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,393
Damn.

210
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,564
Sake, give me sake.

211
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,668
Why can't I box?

212
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,143
I am handicapped.

213
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:14,620
Handing flowers to the stars 
had just become custom.

214
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,004
Be quiet.

215
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,919
And it's a rose.

216
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,730
I hate cheap flowers.

217
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,160
If someone sent me carnation,

218
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,550
I will return it at once.

219
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,149
Bullshit!

220
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,880
What, little brat.

221
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:33,280
What did you say?

222
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,137
Whatever you brag about,

223
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,568
I know who you really are.

224
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,246
I saw everything.

225
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,664
What did you see?

226
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,852
What you did in the street.

227
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,796
You are a bar girl, aren't you?

228
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,741
When you can't get customers 
due to your age.

229
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,830
You would offer a price as low as 3000 yen.

230
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,483
I'm a bar girl, so what?

231
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,668
I'm not someone's wife. 
Wives are not clean either.

232
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,820
Where does this s.o.b. come from?

233
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,363
Wanna hit me, do you think I fear you?

234
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:17,208
Stop

235
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,208
Shut up. Stop bullshiting.

236
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,378
You're no better than I.

237
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:34,642
Stop, no more quarrels.

238
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,645
I lied to you all.

239
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,740
I was taken as a fool.

240
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,215
Why couldn't I box?

241
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,236
Who are you?

242
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,002
Never expected he had 
such a pretty daughter.

243
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:48,039
Emm, don't tell mom 
that I have been here.

244
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,239
Why?

245
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,591
My mother is rather jealous.

246
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,060
Is this your school uniform?

247
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:02,144
No, I don't go to school.

248
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:05,679
Why don't you wear longer skirts.

249
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,347
With this dress, people 
could see your underpants.

250
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,975
It's intended to be seen.

251
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,849
Uncle you are way too behind the time.

252
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,538
Is it intended to be seen?

253
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:18,344
Oops, it's hot.

254
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:26,854
No advertising here.

255
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,949
Don't move, huh.

256
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,584
I'm catching the lice for you.

257
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:40,312
I'm so exhausted.

258
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,004
I'm not home.

259
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,681
Be quiet, do you know 
what time is it now?

260
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,110
I have something important.

261
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,185
Important or not, it's no use, if 
whoever you are looking for isn't here.

262
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,890
But I hear something inside.

263
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,724
What?

264
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,602
He said, "I'm not home."

265
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:14,421
Since he said so, 
why don't you believe so?

266
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,362
Good night.

267
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,699
What do you want?

268
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,222
Here's some money, for your brother.

269
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,424
I don't need it.

270
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:20,628
I have a request.

271
00:42:21,784 --> 00:42:22,745
I have a request.

272
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,531
Teach me boxing.

273
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,787
I beg you.

274
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,735
Teach me boxing please.

275
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:52,076
I want to be champion, be seen on TV.

276
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,344
I want to make a fortune, 
to surprise everyone.

277
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,684
Damn it.

278
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,361
You killed my brother,

279
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,354
yet you dare to ask me 
to teach you boxing.

280
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:18,575
NO.

281
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,395
It was an accident.

282
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,230
I want to be a boxer next to no one.

283
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,667
Let me ask you again.

284
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,099
Was it really an accident?

285
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,415
Yes, it was.

286
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,887
Even if it was an accident, 
you still killed my brother.

287
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,060
I know.

288
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,148
Boxing is not for everyone.

289
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,416
Do you hate people?

290
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,402
I can hate people.

291
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,690
Really?

292
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,067
Sure.

293
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,986
Who can you hate?

294
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
My dad, my mom.

295
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,890
My siblings. Yaeyama!

296
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,034
Okinawa!

297
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,574
Damn, I hate the whole world.

298
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,084
Good morning.

299
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:57,930
Huh, greetings to me today? 
How unusual!

300
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,717
Again.

301
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,779
No arms used, just stomach.

302
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,682
Keep it.

303
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,520
Amateur Boxing Competititon.
Who will win the 300,000 yen reward?

304
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,000
[poster] Fight! If you are man enough.

305
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,220
[poster] Burn your forgotten anger.

306
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,890
He is battering the opponent's 
cringing body.

307
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,443
He wins!

308
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,750
Another amateur boxer, 21 years old,

309
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,585
looks young and energetic.

310
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:12,920
Toshio, beat him.

311
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,947
Arai, another amateur boxer.

312
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,530
19 years old, stout,

313
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,703
fight fiercely with his topless body.

314
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,296
Papa, will you try it too?

315
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:48,454
Will you?

316
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,332
Tsuchihara raises his arms in triumph.

317
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,731
Who volunteers to challenge him?

318
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,486
A new challenger appears.

319
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:04,281
He is Yamamoto, a 49 year-old clerk.

320
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,283
Can he beat Tsuchihara?

321
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,897
Papa, good luck!

322
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,980
Knock him down.

323
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,690
What are you doing there?

324
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:37,534
Go home! Go home!

325
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,257
Have you ever tried this?

326
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,260
Both sides have supporters.

327
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,122
The match is a little bit boring,
but they are doing their best.

328
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,648
Ah, Yamamoto is down!

329
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,199
Imagine this is the boxing champion.

330
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,565
Suppose he's someone you hate.
Hit him, hit him hard.

331
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,099
Then you'll feel fine.

332
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:00,805
Forward

333
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,321
Stronger! Stronger!

334
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:23,070
You can't beat your opponent 
with these blows.

335
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,200
Hey, you two.

336
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,133
What are you doing 
in someone else's place?

337
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,924
Beat it.

338
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,384
More force with your feet.

339
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,999
Come up quickly.

340
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,828
No fun in the water, you fool.

341
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,360
Mizue always says 
she wants to leave home,

342
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,100
while I have to return home 
from the bar rather late.

343
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,250
The bar?

344
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,950
Yes, a bar. I couldn't 
leave it until 11pm.

345
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:39,070
Some customers would 
even come to my house.

346
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,760
Are you still working at those places?

347
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,101
But, we have to earn some money.

348
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,570
You could let your husband to earn it.

349
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,130
I'm waiting for an opportunity 
to talk to you about our remarriage.

350
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,640
May be you will start working again.

351
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,940
Hey, let's rebuild our family, shall we?

352
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:50,900
I won't complain about our life any more.

353
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,400
We have been separated 
for such a long time.

354
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,690
It isn't right.

355
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,310
Besides,

356
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,210
I won't talk about boxing any more.

357
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,800
I will earn some money too,

358
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,090
and smile for you as well.

359
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,870
Tenma, Tenma.

360
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,040
I'm coming in.

361
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,530
Hey.

362
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,996
It's so dark. Turn the light on.

363
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,140
The light is on.

364
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,502
Get a brighter light then.

365
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,660
Maybe it's better to 
take my name card there.

366
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,463
Don't worry.

367
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,940
Here's the schedule of the match.

368
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,018
It's so dark here.

369
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,865
Emmm, a girl?

370
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,720
She is my brother's girlfriend, isn't she?

371
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,570
You really are in love with her, huh?

372
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:07,040
With a girl's photo in the room, 
you won't feel that lonely.

373
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,630
OK. But change the girl next time.

374
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,730
How is that girl now?

375
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,430
I don't know either.

376
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,810
Any cigarettes here?

377
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,420
Someone gave it to me.

378
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:50,974
How about yourself?

379
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,910
I don't smoke.

380
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,729
Match.

381
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,333
Ashtray.

382
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,377
How is your foot?

383
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:39,359
No problem.

384
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,909
Completely recovered.

385
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,972
It's said,

386
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,250
that you quit your last match.

387
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,520
even though you could win.

388
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,506
Yeah. I could win it.

389
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,819
Then why quit?

390
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,903
Tenma

391
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,219
Don't ask. Anything I tell you now 
would be mere excuses.

392
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,800
I just suddenly wanted to quit.

393
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,690
That's it.

394
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,000
What do you have after you quit?

395
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,823
Hey, Dad.

396
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,890
Why did you quit boxing?

397
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,794
Tell me please.

398
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,540

Ebihara Hiroyuki wins by KO 1st Round, 
2min 7sec.

427
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,560
Really? Are my palm prints so favorable?

428
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,110
Yes, I haven't seen any better ones.

429
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,820
Then I should have some 
dialogues this time.

430
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,680
I have been extras for many years.

431
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,490
This is not water.

432
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,290
It's real alcohol inside.

433
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,486
No, it's water.

434
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,570
Why don't you bet on it?

435
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,300
water or alcohol.

436
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,610
Whoever loses will have a cup of 
bathing water. How is that?

437
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,690
I can't stand you pervert.

438
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,900
Good palm.

439
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,585
Really?

440
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,810
What can you destroy with your fists?

441
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,190
You can't even destroy a car.

442
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,160
Can you beat Piston the world champion?

443
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:01,780
Boxing in the street is violence.

444
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,000
But boxing in the ring is 
competing for championship.

445
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,190
How savage!

446
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,950
Don't you think so?

447
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,160
Huh, don't you maintain weight any more?

448
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,590
I quit.

449
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,383
Really?

450
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,140
Well.

451
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,950
Boxing is boring.

452
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,469
Anyway,

453
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,069
not for poor people at least.

454
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,312
One more helping.

455
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,110
Let's go.

456
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:10,504
Let's go.

457
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,019
Straight punch.

458
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:39,828
Champion!

459
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,630
Pork Chop and Rice

460
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,880
Pork Chop and Rice, too?

461
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:58,171
Pork Chop and Rice

462
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,180
Pork Chop and Rice

463
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,620
2 Pork Chop and Rice.

464
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,890
I want a Pork Chop and Rice too.

465
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,290
No idea if we have enough pork.

466
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:10,410
Pork Chop and Rice

467
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,249
Pork Chop and Rice again?

468
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,440
What happened?

469
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,270
Little Ten will have 
boxing match in a few days.

470
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,670
I decide to have Pork Chop and Rice everyday.
<font size=10>(In Japanese, Pork Chop and Rice is katudon while victory is katu. So people have katudon before competitions for good luck.)</font>

471
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:29,840
Katudon every day, victory is at hand.
We have katudon, victory goes to Ten.

472
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:34,790
Momo, move here. Hang this up.

473
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,490
OK.

474
01:08:48,411 --> 01:08:49,950
Tenma Tessho

475
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:52,000
won 5, lost 1.

476
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,330
KO 5.

477
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,030
Round 2

478
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,066
Don't you go to the party?

479
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:10,139
We are all waiting for you.

480
01:11:11,562 --> 01:11:12,642
Come on.

481
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:18,536
Winning this match doesn't mean 
winning the championship.

482
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:20,516
He could win, he definitely will.

483
01:11:35,845 --> 01:11:38,687
What happened? He's so pitiful.

484
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:40,669
He can't last very long, too old now.

485
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:42,828
No, he's just unhappy.

486
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:46,980
You always hang out with that boxer.

487
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:48,258
So?

488
01:11:49,129 --> 01:11:51,463
He's jealous.

489
01:11:55,415 --> 01:11:57,325
Oh, it's him who's ill.

490
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:00,896
I heard someone is not well, 
so I bring some medicine.

491
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:05,906
It's rare you are here.
Don't you have training today?

492
01:12:10,464 --> 01:12:14,771
He claimed he had completely recovered.
Will all these be in vain?

493
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:49,778
You guys don't stop drinking. 
I will drink too.

494
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:20,115
Hey, you are still training.

495
01:13:21,221 --> 01:13:22,272
Yes, sort of.

496
01:13:22,434 --> 01:13:26,515
You opponent in the final is from 
Shanghai, he's rather strong.

497
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:28,746
I see.

498
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:32,961
The match will determine your future.

499
01:13:33,566 --> 01:13:36,094
Do you dare try?

500
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:58,457
He's a newbie, from Okinawa.

501
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,292
Nice to meet you.

502
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:01,472
Me too.

503
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:02,800
Thanks.

504
01:14:02,835 --> 01:14:04,022
Let's go.

505
01:14:33,495 --> 01:14:37,321
You are indeed here, just as I expected.

506
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:45,332
Let's send him to a doctor.

507
01:14:46,131 --> 01:14:50,642
Otherwise he will suffer for a week
for the dirt falling into his eye.

508
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:59,891
Mizue is strange these days.

509
01:15:01,002 --> 01:15:04,673
Not a word after returning home.

510
01:15:07,384 --> 01:15:09,318
The kid has reached puberty.

511
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:17,565
Oh, paper plane.

512
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:26,356
We have been here, right.

513
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:28,544
I still remember it.

514
01:15:29,598 --> 01:15:34,960
It's when you quit the match.

515
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:43,191
You always come here 
when you have something in mind.

516
01:15:46,945 --> 01:15:47,991
Harumi,

517
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,887
I haven't seen you smiling 
for a long time.

518
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:50,280
I'm coming in.

519
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:46,602
Where's your father?

520
01:17:47,341 --> 01:17:49,506
Probably went to the doctor with the dog.

521
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,444
Go preparing.

522
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:35,820
Training.

523
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,134
What happened? Get up!

524
01:21:56,506 --> 01:21:57,897
Where is he going?

525
01:21:57,898 --> 01:22:01,928
Looks drunk. The dog is 
drinking beer these days.

526
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:02,631
Beer.

527
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:49,378
What happened?

528
01:22:54,937 --> 01:22:58,632
Dad, can I go to see the match on the 9th.

529
01:22:59,997 --> 01:23:01,552
That guy will win, right?

530
01:23:20,033 --> 01:23:22,251
Shirai Yoshio, 
former World flyweight Champion.

531
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:24,986
Gunji Nobuo, boxing critic.

532
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:27,793
Fighting Harada, former World 
flyweight & bantamweight Champion.

533
01:23:28,265 --> 01:23:30,589
Ebihara Hiroyuki, 
former World flyweight Champion.

534
01:23:31,916 --> 01:23:34,588
Shibada Kuniaki, 
former World featherweight Champion.

535
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,484
Gattu Ishimatu, 
former World lightweight Champion.

536
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:41,022
Saijyo Syozo, 
former World featherweight Champion.

537
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:44,186
Wajima koichi, 
former World middleweight Champion.

538
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:03,369
Look. How is this?

539
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:04,763
Is it too flashy?

540
01:24:05,706 --> 01:24:06,873
But do wear it.

541
01:24:07,587 --> 01:24:08,992
We spent a lot of time on it.

542
01:24:11,144 --> 01:24:13,015
Hey, will you win?

543
01:24:14,898 --> 01:24:17,600
Be sure to win, we all 
come here to cheer you on.

544
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:21,207
Mr Hayato, your phone.

545
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:02,495
Hello.

546
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,556
Papa, I couldn't watch 
the match today. I'm sorry.

547
01:25:08,457 --> 01:25:14,303
Oh, Mizue. Where are you now?
I'm worrying about you now.

548
01:25:15,106 --> 01:25:17,596
I'm at my friend's home.

549
01:25:18,751 --> 01:25:21,642
He's having a birthday party.

550
01:25:22,491 --> 01:25:24,512
We are having cakes 
and having fun. Don't worry.

551
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:27,892
Be sure to win.

552
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,054
Goodbye.

553
01:25:50,297 --> 01:25:51,143
OK. Let's go.

554
01:25:55,292 --> 01:25:58,705
Be sure to win. We still need 
some money for our wedding.

555
01:25:58,706 --> 01:25:59,706
Sure.

556
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:39,159
Ten-Ma

557
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,959
Now, the 6th competition of 
World J-Flyweight Tournament.

558
01:26:47,005 --> 01:26:59,684
The red side is Haijian from Tenjin Gym.

559
01:27:03,611 --> 01:27:13,979
The black side is Tenma Tessho 
from Niten Gym.

560
01:27:18,253 --> 01:27:29,382
The referee is Suzuki takeshi 
and Nakada Akira.

561
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:05,466
Wait a moment.

562
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:06,562
Right.

563
01:28:09,162 --> 01:28:11,766
Defense. That's right.

564
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:24,599
Attack his right side, Tenma. Right.

565
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:25,929
Damn.

566
01:28:26,904 --> 01:28:27,926
Straight punch.

567
01:29:37,082 --> 01:29:38,935
Defense. Be careful.

568
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:56,603
Your opponent always attacks your left side.

569
01:29:57,907 --> 01:30:00,195
Weigh yourself on the right. Understand?

570
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:04,845
Move in circle, then a straight punch.

571
01:30:11,998 --> 01:30:12,616
It's OK.

572
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:43,689
Don't forget the right side, Tenma.

573
01:30:43,729 --> 01:30:47,648
Pay attention to defense. Be careful.

574
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,721
Move it. Move it.

575
01:31:43,066 --> 01:31:44,436
Don't hurry.

576
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:45,772
See it clearly.

577
01:32:23,535 --> 01:32:28,980
Come on, Tenma. Come on, Tenma.

578
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,741
I'm OK.

579
01:32:55,756 --> 01:32:57,493
Keep on fighting.

580
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,265
I could kill him.

581
01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:27,130
Get up. Get up!

582
01:33:28,405 --> 01:33:30,447
Get up and show us.

583
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:05,249
You loser, couldn't even get up.

584
01:34:21,709 --> 01:34:22,624
Last Round

585
01:34:48,473 --> 01:34:49,555
Dodge, Tenma.

586
01:35:24,936 --> 01:35:26,588
Get up if you are a man.

587
01:35:29,915 --> 01:35:32,047
Get up and show us.

588
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:38,778
What happened? Is it so hard to get up?

589
01:35:40,994 --> 01:35:43,693
What are you doing lying there. Damn.

590
01:35:46,609 --> 01:35:48,464
Get up if you refuse to be a loser.

591
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:53,044
Tenma.

592
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,313
Tenma.

593
01:37:08,779 --> 01:37:15,339
